Haskell plugin for LightTable
===
For Stanford CS 240h project, we are working on a plugin for LightTable to make it easier to learn and write code in Haskell. Initially basing our project off the existing plugin.






# Status

**Due to the lack of progress on LightTable, I'm no longer maintaining this plugin. Feel free to fork if you'd like to continue work.**


Haskell plugin for LightTable
===

Currently it supports:
* Hoogling via `ctrl-shift-d` and selecting hsh (default)
* Hayooing via `ctrl-shift-d` and selecting hsy (this gives weird results right now)
* Hoogling inline via `ctrl-d`
* Stylish haskell via sidebar "Haskell: Reformat file"
* Syntax checking via sidebar "Haskell: Check syntax"
* Linting via sidebar "Haskell: Check lint"
* Evaluating the current line or selection via `ctrl-enter` or `cmd-enter`
* Get type of expression via sidebar "Haskell: Get the type of a form in editor"


Requirements
===

A recent version of `cabal` that supports `sandbox`, `run`, and `repl`. This must be on a load path that LightTable can read.


Installation
===

Install using the plugin manager.

This plugin is in the early stages, and can use any kind of help. The best place to start is the issues. I've marked things as `easy` that should be, well, easy. Feel free to comment on any issue asking for help/direction.

The best way to get going is to install this plugin by checking it out (or symlink it) into the plugins directory of your LightTable installation. For example, on OS X:

```bash
cd /Applications/LightTable.app/Contents/Resources/app.nw/plugins
git clone git@github.com:jetaggart/light-haskell.git haskell
```

The plugin directory must be named `haskell` due to LightTable plugin load paths.

Restart LightTable, and run the command (ctrl-space) `Show plugin manager`. You should see Haskell as an installed plugin. After, simply go to a
haskell file and start running the commands. The plugin bootstraps itself and builds the executable, so give it a minute the first time around.
If you don't see what you expect after running a command and waiting a bit, try restarting LightTable. If you still are having trouble, please look at the bottom bar for errors and don't hesitate to submit an issue or help out.

To add functionality, I usually start with testing the haskell client with the ruby server that simulates LightTable. Start by going into the plugin dir and run:

```bash
ruby test_server.rb
./run-server.sh 5555 456 .
```

The ruby script will fire off various commands to the haskell client. You can check it's output to see that it succeeds (or fails). From there, I just figure out how to make LightTable send the data in the format I need it.
